Initially working with audios:

Isochronic tones, creating fibonacci sequences using as seeds `2` values applied to the base frequencies and pulse frequencies.

1. Seeds 1 and 1: Which is the same proportion of taking the seeds `1 and 2` or `2 and 3`.

Sequence: `1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711 Hertz`.

Perceptible to the ear as base frequencies: `From 21 Hertz to 17711 Hertz`.

2. Seeds 1 and 3: Which is the same proportion of taking seeds `3 and 4`.

Sequence: `1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, 322, 521, 843, 1364, 2207, 3571, 5778, 9349, 15127, 24476 Hertz`.

Perceptible to the ear as base frequencies: `From 18 Hertz to 15127 Hertz`.

3. EMDR. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing. Applied here for auditory stimulation. [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing)
